# Pursuing-My-Dream

Here i will share my learnings with this simple project. The idea is to get used with Unity and keep gradually working into the project.
<br>
As i say, "slow and steady".

Project idea:
To create a simple level were i can experiment with the tools Unity provides. Like a "tech demo" of what i can do with the tools available.

Already implemented:
- Character movement, with built-in debug features
- Character animations, yet simple but functional
- Effectors 2d, serving as examples of what they can do (with some UI explanations of them)

Next steps:
- Finish the visual aspects of the level
- Do some physics related tweaks
- Create a second level with an objective (reach point B)
